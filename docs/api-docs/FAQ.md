### Frequently Asked Questions 


**Q: Is this a production API?**

A: No this is strictly for reference purposes.

**Q: Where is the production endpoint?**

A: That is not available because this is not for production usage.

**Q: How did you make the design decisions for this API?**

A: We are using the [draft GSA API Standards](https://github.com/GSA/api-standards/tree/converting-gsa-standards). This API is meant to demonstrate those.

**Q: Which parts of the API Standards does this demonstrate?**

A: It does not demonstrate all of them (yet). However, you can learn about the standards it does demonstrate here: [Implementation of API Standards](https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api/blob/master/standards.md).

**Q: Where did you get that great API documentation?**

A: Glad you asked! You can find that documentation here: [https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template)

**Q: Where can I view the source code of this API?**

A: You can find the source code here: [https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api](https://github.com/GSA/prototype-city-pairs-api)

**Q: Are these fares valid in either direction?**

A: Yes. All fares are valid in either direction.

**Q: Are these fares one-way or round-trip?**

A: All fares are listed one-way.

**Q: Are domestic and international fares queried the same way?**

A: No. For domestic routes, please use the airport code. City codes (e.g., Washington(WAS)) are for use with international routes.

**Q: Can you provide a sample API client or SDK for this API?**

A: We are not providing these at this time. However, some tools can generate API clients based on the <a href="http://swagger.io/specification/">OpenAPI Specification 2.0</a> format in this file: <a href="console/citypairs.json">citypairs.json</a>. One example of tools is the online Swagger Editor: [http://editor.swagger.io](http://editor.swagger.io). **We do not provide any guarantees of functionality or security of these tools.**
