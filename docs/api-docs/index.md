### Overview 

The prototype City Pairs API is a demonstration project built to demonstrate the [draft GSA API Standards](https://github.com/GSA/api-standards/tree/converting-gsa-standards) and the [https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template](https://github.com/GSA/api-documentation-template).
